# trsync.sh
Threaded rsync wrapper
```
# CREATE A FILE CALLED "TNUM" AT THE LOCATION YOU'RE RUNNING FROM
# TO ADJUST THREADCOUNT FOR THIS SCRIPT AT RUNTIME. (E.G. echo -n "25" > TNUM)
# adjust the find commands in the SYNCS variable to set the folders to be synced
# the same directoy structure should be created at the destination
```
further usability upgrades will be incoming in the future, but for now script modification is required.
